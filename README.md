you are going to create a mini Dashboard for e-commerce app.

fulfill the Admin stories:

- the Admin can see all the products cards and the stock availability(number of products).
- the Admin can add a new product.
- the Admin can update the price, name ,quantity and options.
- Admin can delete a product
- the Admin can filter by price,product ,name and category
- the admin can search for any product with name and category
  you are going to implement four tables `Admin`,`product`,`category` and create their relationships.

**_ Admin table atributes(`name`) _**
**_ product table atributes(`name,imageUrl,price,quantity,options(promotion,verified,deliveryCost,Available,no option),adminId,categoryId`) _**
**_ category table atributes(`name`) _**

(you can create a small authentication using an input to create a Admin in your database)
Happy hacking
